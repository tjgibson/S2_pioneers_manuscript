# Discussion

## outline:

### Summary of study

### Pioneer-factor activity occurs on a spectrum and is context dependent

-   Twi is a PF

-   In our study, we see a range of pioneering activities: Twi\<Zld\<Grh

### Pioneer factors are regulated by both protein-intrinsic and protein-extrinsic features Local chromatin.

-   **Active chromatin:**

    -   promotes PF binding in the absence fo strong motifs.

    -   H3K27me3, despite correlation, does not affect binding and pioneering

-   **Protein concentration**:

    -   Strong determinant of binding and chromatin opening in our study.

    -   Different binding sites have different thresholds for binding and opening.
        Some remain unbound even at high levels.

-   **Cofactors**?

-   Not explored extensively in our study.
    How to discuss without inviting more experiments from reviewers?

-   **Motif content**:

    -   Strong predictor of binding and opening.

-   **Protein domains**:

    -   Required for stable binding and opening.

    -   Allows uncoupling of binding from opening.

### Model:

-   PF activity requires high chromatin occupancy which can be achieved in a variety of ways.

### Regions outside the DBD are essential for pioneering

-   This and other recent evidence complicates the simple modular model of TF function

-   Multiple possibilities for how IDRs or activation domains could impact pioneering:

    -   multivalent interactions with nucleosomes stabilize binding (supported by in vitro evidence).

    -   Recruitment/interaction with cofactors that stabilizes binding (chromatin opening via cofactors could provide positive feedback that stabilizes binding)

    -   Allowing broader exploration of nuclear space, including repressed domains (supported by imaging data)

    -   Clustering or phase separation that increases local concentration

### Future directions we could mention:

-   How do Zld, Grh, Twi and other PFs interact with nucleosomal targets?
    TFs likely have diverse mechanisms of interaction, making it important to characterize for many factors.

-   What are the mechanisms of chromatin opening for these factors?
    Do they recruit remodelers?
    Does binding alone destabilize nucleosomes?

-   How do regions outside the DBD contribute to binding and opening?
