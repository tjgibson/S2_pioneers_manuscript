# Discussion

Major conclusions to emphasize:

-   Twist is a pioneer factor

-   PF activity occurs on a spectrum and is context-dependent.

-   Context-dependent PF activity can be regulated by both protein-intrinsic and extrinsic features.

-   Preexisting active chromatin attracts TF binding, even with weaker motifs.

-   Most functional binding occurs at canonical motifs in na√Øve chromatin

-   Sequence composition is a main determinant of PF binding and activity

-   Regions outside the DBD are essential for pioneering
