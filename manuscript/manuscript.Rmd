# Abstract

# Introduction

# Results

## Ectopic pioneer factors bind and open closed chromatin

## Chromatin opening correlates with transcriptional activation

## Twist binds closed chromatin extensively and opens chromatin at some sites

## Motif content distinguishes chromatin opening by Twist from Zelda and Grainy head

## Ectopic transcription factors bind nonspecifically to active chromatin

## Cloning

*zld*, *grh*, or *twi* cDNA (isoforms RB, RH, and RA, respectively) were cloned into pMT-puro plasmid (Addgene) via Gibson cloning (New England Biolabs). For cloning of the Zld and Grh DNA-binding domains, DNA encoding amino acids 1114-1487 (Zld) or amino acids 603-1032 (Grh) was cloned into pMT-puro.

## Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines

Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at 27°C in Schneider's medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific) and antibiotic/antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the generation of stable cell lines, cells were plated at 5✕10^5^ cells per mL. After 24 hours, cells were transfected with 10 µg plasmid DNA using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). After an additional 24 hours, puromycin was added to a final concentration of 2 µg/mL. Stable cell lines were recovered after 2-3 weeks of selection. Following recovery of stable cell lines, cells were cultured with 1 µg/mL puromycin.

## Induction of transcription factor expression

## Immunoblotting

Proteins were separated on denaturing polyacramide gels before transfer to a 0.45 μm Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM Glycine, 20% methanol) for 60 min (75 min for Zld) at 500mA at 4°C. The membranes were blocked with BLOTTO (2.5% non-fat dry milk, 0.5% BSA, 0.5% NP-40, in TBST) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-Zld (1:750) (Harrison et al., 2010), anti-Grh (1:1000) (Harrison et al., 2010), anti-Twi (1:1000) (He et al. 2015), anti-HA-peroxidase (1:500) (clone 3F10, Roche), or anti-Tubulin (DM1A, 1:5000) (Sigma), overnight at 4°C. The secondary incubation was performed with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (1:3000) (Bio-Rad) for 1 hr at room temperature. Blots were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized using the Azure Biosystems c600 or Kodak/Carestream BioMax Film (VWR).
